# Contributing

We appreciate your input! We aim to make contributing to this project as straightforward and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use Github Flow, so all code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the AGPL Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [AGPL License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/elenpay/nodeguard/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/elenpay/nodeguard/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Here's an example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
> 
> A summary of the issue and the .NET/C# environment in which it occurs. If suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
> 
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
> 
> `<a link to the reduced test case>`
> 
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their merits).
